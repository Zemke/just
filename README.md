# Just

Richly featured Instant Messenger with focus on just chatting.

There's no registration, no syncing with your address book or sharing your phone number. You're anonymously identified by your personal unique Just code that you share only with the people you want to contact with.

Peer-to-peer video and voice calls, GIF sharing, image sharing, camera support, advanced link sharing, share from other Apps (on Android), location sharing, message reactions (tapbacks), Markdown inline and block code formatting, large emoji, Push notifications (on Android and Desktop) and much more.
