# Just — without the flutter and reacts

Just is a messenger without a contact list and the need of account creation while still offering the features you are used to from other messenger.

When you identify yourself using your email address you are given a code that is unique to you and you can share it with only the people you want to chat with.

This is nothing like you are registering and all people in your contacts will get notified about it.

I personally only have one person I chat with and I can use this messenger for just doing that and not getting messaged by other people in my phone’s contacts out of nothing.

Under the hood this is just a web app. Add it to your Home screen and it will work like a native App (iOS not supported). \
On your Desktop you can simply access the site and using Chrome you’re given the the opportunity of installing it as a standalone App on your computer.

Messsages are encrypted during transfer from your device to the server and to the recipient. Messages are not encrypted on the server and not encrypted on your device and the device of the person you are chatting with (unless device encryption is turned on but that is up to the people).
